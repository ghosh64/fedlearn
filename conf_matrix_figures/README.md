# Results

Confusion matrices for results presented in the paper are available here for our different testing scenarios. 

diff_input: differential input setup

tmp_avg_run1: temporal avg runs
tmp_avg_run2: temporal avg runs

trans: federated transferability using train_resnet.py

tmp_avg_tested_avg: temporal avg runs; tested for transferability on averaged data
